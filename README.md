# HackTheBox Linux Resources
`Getting into HTB can be difficult. Let's make it a little bit easier.`

When you start off on Hack The Box, you might not know where to begin;  
my hope is that providing a basic set of tools, concepts, and methodologies  
can provide a foundation to develop on while you're going after your first few boxes.  
For each stage, I've accumulated two or three of the topics I've seen the most across machines.

Every HTB machine has a similar kill chain:
 - [**Reconnaissance**](Reconnaissance.md): Discovering what exists on the machine.
 - [**Foothold**](Foothold.md): Exploiting the web application or services on the machine
 - [**User**](User.md): Finding a way into a staff account with a few more privileges
 - [**Root**](Root.md): Exploiting a privilege escalation to access the system's root account.
 
Beyond these materials, getting hints for the machines from  
the [HTB Forum](https://forum.hackthebox.eu/) is a great way to learn and develop your skills.  
You can also go through retired boxes with [IppSec's videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA).  
If any of this helped you, feel free to add a respect to my HTB page!
